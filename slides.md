# What is Serverless and FaaS?

<v-clicks>

- Resources on As-Used Basis

- No Infrastructure to Manage

- Scales Automatically

- Triggered by Events

</v-clicks>

<!--
Serverless doesn‚Äôt mean there are no servers ‚Äî it just means you don‚Äôt have to manage them.

Resources on as-used basis:
Serverless is very resource-efficient ‚Äî you only pay for the compute time you actually consume. It scales to zero when there's no traffic, so you're not paying for idle capacity.

No infrastructure to manage:
You don‚Äôt need to manage or patch servers. That‚Äôs handled by the cloud provider. This frees you up to focus on writing business logic instead of operations.

Scales automatically:
Serverless functions adjust automatically to load ‚Äî they scale up during high traffic and back down when it's quiet, without manual intervention.

Triggered by events:
Functions are invoked by events, like HTTP requests, messages, or file uploads. This makes serverless a natural fit for event-driven architectures, integrations, and automation flows.

<!--

- Cloud Agnostic: Enables apps to run across AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or locally without code changes.
- Adaptable: Supports web endpoints, streaming, or background tasks with the same function.
- Spring Boot Features: You get dependency injection, config, and metrics even in FaaS.
- GraalVM: Optimizes cold start, though AWS SnapStart or Azure Premium are alternatives.

# Clean Architecture for Serverless

<img src="/CleanArch.png" alt="Clean Architecture" style="width: 80%; height: auto;" />


<!--
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different aspects of software development (use case business rules, domain logic,
  integration logic) are isolated from each other.

- **Independent Layers**: Changes in one layer (like switching cloud providers) should not affect other layers.

- **Testability**: Because of the clear boundaries and interfaces between layers, testing becomes straightforward.

- **Minimizing Cloud Lock-in**: Easily switch between AWS, Azure, or others, with business logic unaware of the
  underlying cloud provider.

Imagine we are build a pension administration microservice,

- in application we have use case business logic, for example process employment, marriage, divorce, death
- infra has integration to our cloud specific service, e.g. Azure blob storage & Service Bus or AWS S3 and Event Bridge
- cdk has cloud specific infrastructure as code


MockNest: 
- in domain we would have everything with mocking, in our case wiremock has all the logic so we do not have much here
- in application we have use case business logic, so actual forwarding logic to wiremock, and also any extra functionality specific for the use cases rather than domain
- infra has integration to our cloud specific service, e.g. Azure blob storage and Azure function
AWS S3 and AWS lambda
- cdk has cloud specific infrastructure as code

# Clean Architecture - With Gradle Modules

How would the module definition look in Gradle Kotlin DSL?

**settings.gradle.kts:**

```kotlin
include(":application")
project(":application").projectDir = file("software/application")
include(":domain")
project(":domain").projectDir = file("software/domain")
// ... other modules
```

**application/build.gradle.kts:**

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(project(":domain"))
}

<!-- 
(Call Azure)

So wer are not using a Hello world, however the use case is still simple, we hve some business logic which requires some persistence, and we are using a cloud specific service for this persistence. In AWS we will use S3, and in Azure we are using Blob Storage. These are exactly what we need to store our mock configuration.

# üßë‚Äçüíª Live Coding: From Hello World to Business Logic

<!--
Let's update our Hello world Lambda and Azure function to use the busness logic which is a WireMock with some forwarding logic for serverless:
- update module dependencies
```kotlin
implementation(project(":domain"))
```
- wire in business logic from functions

```kotlin
private val handleWireMockRequest: HandleWireMockRequest,
private val handleAdminRequest: HandleAdminRequest,
```

- Implement Azure wiremock request handling

```kotlin
val response = handleWireMockRequest(
            HttpRequest(
                org.springframework.http.HttpMethod.valueOf(request.httpMethod.name),
                request.headers,
                route,
                request.queryParameters,
                request.body
            )
        )
```

- Implement Azure wiremock response handling

```kotlin
val response = handleAdminRequest(
            route ?: "",
            HttpRequest(
                SpringHttpMethod.valueOf(request.httpMethod.name),
                request.headers,
                route,
                request.queryParameters,
                request.body
            )
        )
```

- map wiremock response to azure api response

```kotlin
.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.valueOf(response.httpStatusCode.value()))
            .let { responseBuilder ->
                var builder = responseBuilder
                response.headers?.forEach { header ->
                    header.value.forEach {
                        builder = builder.header(header.key, it)
                    }
                }
                builder
            }
            .body(response.body)

```
- Add dependency and inject our request handling functions into AWS Lambda
- Convert our Lambda secific request to oour domain object

```kotlin
 private fun APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent.createHttpRequest(path: String): HttpRequest {
        val request = HttpRequest(
            method = HttpMethod.valueOf(httpMethod),
            headers = headers,
            path = path,
            queryParameters = queryStringParameters.orEmpty(),
            body = body
        )
        return request
    }
```

- call injected function and convert response

```kotlin
  with(event) {
                logger.info { "MockNest request: $httpMethod $path $headers" }
                if (path.startsWith(ADMIN_PREFIX)) {
                    val adminPath = path.removePrefix(ADMIN_PREFIX)
                    handleAdminRequest(adminPath, createHttpRequest(adminPath))
                } else {
                    handleWireMockRequest(createHttpRequest(path.removePrefix(WIREMOCK_PREFIX)))
                }
            }.let {
                APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent()
                    .withStatusCode(it.httpStatusCode.value())
                    .withHeaders(it.headers?.toSingleValueMap())
                    .withBody(it.body?.toString().orEmpty())
            }
```


Let's update our Hello world Lambda and Azure function to use the busness logic which is a WireMock with some forwarding logic for serverless: 
- inject repository
```kotlin
private val wireMockMappingRepository: WireMockMappingRepository,
```

- call business logic from functions

- add stub mapping
```kotlin
 private fun saveStubMapping(mapping: StubMapping, bodyString: String, ): String {
        return mapping.runCatching {
            if (isPersistent) {
                logger.info { "Saving persistent mapping with ID: $id" }
                wireMockMappingRepository.saveMapping(id.toString(), bodyString).let { "Saved mapping $it" }
            } else "Mapping ${mapping.id} not persistent"
        }.onFailure {
            logger.error(it) { "Failed to check or save persistent mapping: ${it.message}" }
        }.getOrThrow()
    }

 saveStubMapping(mapping, bodyString)
```

- delete all mappings when we call reset
```kotlin
 // Delete all mappings from storage
                    val storedMappings = wireMockMappingRepository.listMappings()
                    storedMappings.forEach { mappingId ->
                        logger.info { "Deleting stored WireMock mapping with ID: $mappingId" }
                        wireMockMappingRepository.deleteMapping(mappingId)
                    }
```

- build, commit and push

# Deployment

```yaml {all|4-5|10-12}
- name: Generate Terraform files
  run: |
    cd ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/cdk
    cdktf get
    cdktf synth

- name: Deploy with Terraform
  run: |

    terraform init -reconfigure
    terraform plan -out=tfplan
    terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
```

<!--
(Run AWS)
Generate Terraform Files

- cdktf get: Fetches the dependencies required for the Terraform CDK code, such as necessary Terraform providers and modules referenced in your CDKTF code.
- cdktf synth: Converts your Kotlin CDKTF code into Terraform JSON files.

Deploy with Terraform

- terraform init -reconfigure

Initializes the Terraform working directory (downloads providers, configures backends).
-reconfigure forces Terraform to ignore any previously saved backend config and re-read it from main.tf.json.
If you're using a remote backend like S3 (AWS), this ensures Terraform reads the real current state from there, instead of looking at a local .tfstate file.
- terraform plan -out=tfplan

Creates an execution plan by comparing the desired state (your Terraform files) with the current state (from the backend).
The plan is saved to a file called tfplan.
This file will then be used for the actual apply step, so you're guaranteed to apply exactly what was planned.

- terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan

Applies the previously generated plan (tfplan) without prompting for approval. What could possibly go wrong? ;)
This ensures only the changes you already reviewed or tested in the plan step are applied ‚Äî no surprises.
